# Water Quality Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report presents an analysis of water quality data containing various contaminant measurements and safety classifications. The dataset consists of 7,996 water samples with 20 measured contaminants and a binary safety indicator. The analysis reveals significant imbalance in the safety classification, with only 11.4% of samples classified as safe (912 samples) compared to 88.6% classified as unsafe (7,084 samples).

## Data Overview
- **Original Dataset**: 7,999 entries with 21 columns
- **Cleaned Dataset**: 7,996 entries (after removing invalid ammonia values)
- **Features**: 20 contaminant measurements (aluminum, ammonia, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chloramine, chromium, copper, fluoride, bacteria, viruses, lead, nitrates, nitrites, mercury, perchlorate, radium, selenium, silver, uranium)
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification (is_safe: 0=unsafe, 1=safe)

## Data Cleaning
- Removed 3 rows containing invalid ammonia values ("#NUM!")
- No missing values were found in the dataset
- No duplicate rows were detected
- Outliers were handled by clipping values using the IQR method (1.5 Ã— IQR)

### Key Contaminant Statistics
| Contaminant | Mean | Std Dev | Min | Median | Max |
|------------|------|---------|-----|--------|-----|
| Aluminum   | 0.67 | 1.27    | 0.00 | 0.07  | 5.05 |
| Arsenic    | 0.16 | 0.25    | 0.00 | 0.05  | 1.05 |
| Barium     | 1.57 | 1.22    | 0.00 | 1.19  | 4.94 |
| Cadmium    | 0.04 | 0.04    | 0.00 | 0.04  | 0.13 |
| Chloramine | 2.18 | 2.57    | 0.00 | 0.53  | 8.68 |
| Chromium   | 0.25 | 0.27    | 0.00 | 0.09  | 0.90 |
| Copper     | 0.81 | 0.65    | 0.00 | 0.75  | 2.00 |
| Fluoride   | 0.77 | 0.44    | 0.00 | 0.77  | 1.50 |
| Lead       | 0.10 | 0.06    | 0.00 | 0.10  | 0.20 |
| Nitrates   | 9.82 | 5.54    | 0.00 | 9.93  | 19.83 |
| Nitrites   | 1.33 | 0.57    | 0.00 | 1.42  | 2.93 |

### Safety Classification Distribution
- **Safe (1)**: 912 samples (11.4%)
- **Unsafe (0)**: 7,084 samples (88.6%)

## Key Findings

1. **Imbalanced Dataset**: The significant imbalance in safety classifications (88.6% unsafe vs. 11.4% safe) indicates this is primarily a dataset of contaminated water samples.

2. **Distribution Patterns**: 
   - Most contaminants show positively skewed distributions
   - Several contaminants (aluminum, chloramine, bacteria, viruses) show particularly wide ranges and high standard deviations

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - A correlation heatmap was generated to identify relationships between contaminants
   - The pairplot visualization helps identify potential patterns between variables

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Outlier treatment was performed using the IQR method
   - The dataset required minimal cleaning with only 3 rows removed due to invalid values

## Recommendations

1. **Address Class Imbalance**: For any predictive modeling, techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic sampling should be considered due to the significant imbalance in the target variable.

2. **Feature Selection**: Based on correlation analysis, feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques could be applied to remove redundant information.

3. **Further Analysis**: Additional exploratory data analysis focusing on the relationships between specific contaminants and water safety classification would provide deeper insights.

4. **Model Development**: Development of machine learning models to predict water safety based on contaminant levels would be a valuable next step.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of water quality data across multiple contaminants. The findings highlight the prevalence of unsafe water samples in the dataset and establish a foundation for further predictive modeling to determine water safety based on contaminant measurements.
